# Building and Deploying Deep Learning Applications with TensorFlow:
## What is TensorFlow?
If you are new to machine learning, you may be wondering what TensorFlow actually is. TensorFlow is a software framework for building and deploying machine learning models. Machine learning is a different approach than traditional programming. With traditional programming, we write the program that tells the computer exactly what to do to complete the task. With machine learning, we don't explicitly tell the computer how to do something. Instead we show a training data and the machine learning algorithm uses the training data that come up with its own rules to complete the task. Developed at Google, TensorFlow was designed to be a common platform for building machine learning applications internally. In late 2015, they decided to share it with the world and release it as an open source application. TensorFlow is licensed under the Apache open source software license. That means you can use it, modify it, and even redistribute modified version of it. You don't have to pay any licensing fees to use TensorFlow. TensorFlow gives you the basic building blocks that you need to design, train, and deploy machine learning models. While it's flexible enough to be used for several different types of machine learning types of algorithms, it's typically used to build deep neural networks. Deep neural networks built with TensorFlow are used in many different areas like image recognition, where you recognize what objects appear in a picture. Speech recognition where you turn speech into text. Image style transfer where you can make a photograph look like it was painted in the style of a famous artist, or language translation where you translate from one human language to another. In this particular course, we'll use TensorFlow to solve a typical business problem estimating sales. We'll build a basic neural network that can estimate the sales of a new video game based on sales of past video games with similar characteristics. But everything we learn about building and deploying with TensorFlow works the same way no matter what kind of application you are using it for. TensorFlow isn't the only option for deep learning. TensorFlow is comparable to other deep learning frameworks like Theano, Torch, and Pytorch. Each framework has its own pros and cons, but all of them are popular within different research groups and companies. It's common for a machine learning researcher to be familiar with several of them. Since TensorFlow was Google solution, Google has helped promote it, and its become one of the more popular choices. It also works well with many Google products like their Cloud ML platform and for deploying machine learning models and Android mobile phones. TensorFlow is a low level toolkit. It can take quite a few lines of code to build a machine learning model in TensorFlow. Because of this, there are wrappers for TensorFlow that simplify common operations. The most popular wrapper for TensorFlow is Keras. Keras is a high level programming toolkit that makes it easy to build many different types of neural networks with only a few lines of code. Keras still uses TensorFlow behind the scenes to actually do the processing. It's a great choice if you don't need the low level flexibility of TensorFlow. My recommendation is to learn how to use TensorFlow on its own first, to make sure you understand what's going on behind the scenes. But once you're familiar with TensorFlow, it's great to also learn how to use Keras. It makes many common tasks much easier and it can be a great time saver.
